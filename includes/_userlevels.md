# Userlevels

In order to add access levels to features of Nightbot, we use the following userlevels:

* **admin** - Nightbot Administrator
* **owner** - Channel Owner/Manager
* **moderator** - Channel Moderator
* **twitch_vip** - Twitch VIP (only for Twitch accounts)
* **regular** - Nightbot Regular (users in the regulars list)
* **subscriber** - Paid Channel Subscriber (called "Channel Members" on YouTube)
* **everyone** - Normal User (default)

The userlevels are listed from highest to lowest. Users in higher userlevels acquire the permissions of the levels below them.
